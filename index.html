<p> Litte poem meanwhile: </p>
<p>In <strong id="City-Poem">Milan</strong>, where time drapes in silk,<br>
Shadows of the past whisper through stone’s quilt,<br>
Streets adorned in marble and dreams interlace,<br>
Telling tales of eras in their embrace. </p>

<p>The Duomo, majestic, bows to the sky,<br>
Its spires reaching where celestial dreams lie,<br>
In stained glass that sings with golden light,<br>
And columns that silently guard the night.</p>

<p>In the gallery, art moves with a gentle grace,<br>
Each mosaic an echo of an ancient face, <br>
Boutiques shimmer with elegance refined,<br>
While cafes murmur in a sweet, soft chime.</p>

<p>Navigli’s canals, winding and serene,<br>
Beneath bridges and lights, where the night is seen,<br>
Reflect dreams embraced by the water’s dance,<br>
Mirroring life in a tranquil romance.</p>

<p>The castle, keeper of legends and lore,<br>
Holds in its walls the echoes of yore,<br>
Of warriors, lovers, and fallen kings,<br>
Who left their heartbeats in these ancient rings.</p>

<p>In the Piazza dei Mercanti, the wind’s soft song,<br>
Speaks of dreams and hopes, where stories belong,<br>
Where past and present entwine and blend,<br>
In an eternal embrace that will never end.</p>

<p><strong id="City-Poem2">Milan</strong>, city of light and boundless art,<br>
Where each street beckons to explore the heart,<br>
Its hidden secrets in whispers fine,<br>
And in every step, the soul finds its design.</p>
